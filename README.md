WDI Week 1 Day 3 Learning about hashes, methods, and variables.

Smoothie Lab: Everyday I make a smoothie out of x ingredients, make them blend.

# Write a function called blend.
# It should take all the smoothie ingredients (not the measurements) and chop up and mix all the characters
# and output a mixed string of characters
# Be sure to remove the spaces, as we don't want any air bubbles in our smoothie!
  
# create a class called Blender
# It should have a method that takes an array of ingredients and returns a mixed string of characters.
# Give the blender an on and off switch and only allow the blender to function when it's on.
# FOR SAFETY'S SAKE When you create a new blender by default it should be off.
# Blend the the smoothie array



=begin
  - grab the keys (ingredients) from the hash... hash.key(value) or hash.keys
  - join them all into a string... .join
  - then split it character by character into an array... .split("")
  - then randomize this array... .shuffle
  - join it again... .join
  - don't forget to delete occurances of spaces... .delete(" ")
  - save this variable... now_blended
  - create blender class
  - write a prompt to turn on the blender
  - write a if else or until loop
  - Time to find out... Does it blend??
